# Simple modal

Here we have a very simple way to create the functionality and structure of a traditional modal

### Core files:
Core files are essential for the component to function.

- [HTML](index.html)
- [JS](main.js)
- [CSS](style.css)

### Add-ons

We can use the modal script together with the [Tab focus area](../tab-focus-area/). This way we make the modal more accessible, because the navigation by TAB will only be inside the modal.
