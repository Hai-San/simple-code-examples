# Simple code examples

A package with several code examples that I've used in several projects and may be useful to you.

The idea is to have a very clean, simple code with the possibility of adaptation to the project that will be used.

To use any of the examples, copy and paste the code into your project and adapt it as needed.

### Examples list
